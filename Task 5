Some protocols like: 

ARP: - Address Resolution Protocol

DNS – Domain Name System

HTTP/HTTPS – Web traffic

TCP – Transmission Control Protocol

UDP – User Datagram Protocol

ICMP – Ping/echo requests


Report: Network Protocol Analysis
Protocols Identified:

DNS (Port 53) – Resolves domain names to IP addresses.

HTTP (Port 80) – Web traffic to unencrypted websites.

TCP – Ensures reliable data transmission.

UDP – Fast, connectionless data transmission.

ICMP – Used for diagnostics like ping.

Packet Details:

Protocol	Source IP	Destination IP	Info
DNS	192.168.1.2	8.8.8.8	Standard query for test.com
HTTP	192.168.1.2	93.184.216.34	GET /index.html
TCP	192.168.1.2	93.184.216.34	SYN, ACK handshakes
ICMP	192.168.1.2	8.8.8.8	Echo (ping) request/reply







Interview Questions and Answers
1. What is Wireshark used for?
Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer used to capture and inspect data packets transmitted over a network. It helps in network troubleshooting, performance analysis, and cybersecurity investigations.

2. What is a packet?
A packet is a small unit of data transmitted over a network. It contains headers (for routing and protocol info) and a payload (actual data being transferred).

3. How to filter packets in Wireshark?
Use the display filter bar. Examples:

http – Show only HTTP packets

ip.addr == 192.168.1.1 – Filter by IP

tcp.port == 80 – Filter by port number

4. What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
TCP	UDP
Connection-oriented	Connectionless
Reliable (ACKs, retries)	Unreliable
Slower	Faster, low overhead
Used in HTTP, FTP	Used in DNS, video streaming

5. What is a DNS query packet?
A DNS query packet is a request sent by a client to a DNS server to resolve a domain name into an IP address (e.g., example.com → 93.184.216.34).

6. How can packet capture help in troubleshooting?
Capturing packets allows you to:

Detect dropped or delayed packets

Identify protocol errors

Locate unauthorized traffic or intrusions

Analyze connection failures

7. What is a protocol?
A protocol is a set of rules governing the format, transmission, and reception of data over a network. Examples: HTTP, TCP, DNS, FTP.

8. Can Wireshark decrypt encrypted traffic?
Yes, partially: If you have the encryption keys (e.g., SSL/TLS pre-master secrets), Wireshark can decrypt certain traffic.

No for end-to-end encrypted traffic without access to keys.
